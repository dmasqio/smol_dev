# Next.js Job Board

This is a modern Job board web application built using the Next.js framework and TypeScript.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js: A React framework for production - it gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more.
- TypeScript: TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It offers classes, modules, and interfaces to help you build robust components.

## Features

- Server-side rendering for improved performance
- Dynamic routing for individual job details
- API routes for fetching job data
- Shared components for consistent layout and job listings
- CSS Modules for scoped styling
- Public assets for static content like favicon and logo
- Environment variables for secure access to API keys

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/jobs](http://localhost:3000/api/jobs). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/jobs.ts`.
